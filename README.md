# world_happiness_and_life_expectancy
I investigate the happiness and life expectancies of countries across the world in a Python project. I provide a scatter plot of the happiness scores of countries throughout the world versus their life expectancies, and I perform a simple linear regression analysis. There is a medium-strength positive association between happiness and life expectancy.
